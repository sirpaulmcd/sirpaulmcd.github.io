# Git

I first learned how to use Git while working on a game development project with some friends.
To help myself learn, I made a cheat sheet. 
The cheat sheet was so well received that I was given the opportunity to rewrite the introductory Git lab for my university.

All of my git related resources can be found in the table below.
