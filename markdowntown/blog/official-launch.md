# Official Launch
### Nov 2, 2020

I've officially launched my personal website to my own custom domain `sirpaulmcd.com`.
Owning a website is something that's been on the back of my mind since I was little. 
It's nice that I've finally found a use for one as a Software Engineering portfolio. 
I have the foundation set up. Now all I have to do is expand the selection.
I'll be picking up another personal project soon.
I have some friends that may want to revamp the Databasify project that we worked on during our masters together.
