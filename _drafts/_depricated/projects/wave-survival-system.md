# Wave Survival System

The wave survival system opens up a new game mode for Onion Trail. Upon entering the scene, a countdown starts warning players of the upcoming wave of enemies. Players are given prep time between waves to collect themselves and loot their surroundings. This system is still a work-in-progress. However, here's a little sneak peak:

The Wave Survival system is designed such that game designers can create a variety of different enemy waves entirely through the Unity Inspector.
