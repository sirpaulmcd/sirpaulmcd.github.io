# Unity Developer Job

### July 26, 2021

In my last post, I mentioned that I was starting to look for game developer jobs. Fortunately for me, it didn't take very long because I had a connection at a mobile game studio. Starting today, I am a Unity Developer for PopReach!

My goal at this job is to learn all that I can regarding game development in Unity and to determine whether game development is the right career for me. If I enjoy myself, the skills I learn at this job will carry forward into the games that I develop in my spare time. Hopefully the job goes well. Wish me luck!
