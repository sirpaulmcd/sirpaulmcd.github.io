# Data Structures and Algorithms Tutorial
### Dec 16, 2020

To help myself better prepare for interviews, I've been learning more about data structures and algorithms.
To facilitate my learning, I've been putting together tutorials for the various concepts as I work through them myself.
Ideally, my notes will be a one-stop-shop for practical DSAA knowledge for myself and anyone else who finds it useful.

The [tutorial series](/tutorials/data-structures-and-algorithms/) will be split into 5 parts:
- Complexity and Big O Notation
- Searching Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Sorting Algorithms
- Algorithm Design and Moving Forward

Hopefully it turns out well!
