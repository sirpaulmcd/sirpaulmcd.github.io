# Gift Exchange Project

### March 7, 2021

Over the past month, I've been busy working through a variety of courses offered by [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/). My goal is to obtain the knowledge required to build and deploy a containerized full stack web application. There is a lot of ground to cover. However, I have been making good progress.

Recently, a friend of mine reached out looking to collaborate on a software project. I pitched the idea of an application used to facilitate gift exchanges and it was well received. We have since began constructing a containerized environment for the project. More information will be available after the GitHub repo becomes public. For now, I'll just say that the development stack involves:

- React/Typescript client
- Express/GraphQL server
- Mongo/Mongoose database

In other news, I've also been hard at work on my game Onion Trail. Recently, I've implemented a system that allows players and enemies to undergo various status effects. For example, the combustion status effect allows players to light on fire. Lit players have an increased movement speed and lose health over time. If a lit player touches a non-lit player, the fire is spread. Here's a little preview:

Lastly, I've put the final chapter of my [data structures and algorithms tutorial series](/tutorials-cheat-sheets/data-structures-and-algorithms/) "algorithm design and moving forward" on hold until I am more experienced/qualified to write about the topic.
