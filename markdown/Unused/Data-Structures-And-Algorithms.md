# Data Structures and Algorithms

Software job interviews are incredibly challenging/technical when compared to other disciplines. 
For these interviews, especially those involving big tech companies, knowledge of data structures and algorithms is incredibly important. 
This is because data structures and algorithms are an essential part of becoming a competent software developer. 
These concepts ensure that you are not just designing functional software but designing software that reaches its peak performance for the desired function. 
This peak performance becomes increasingly important as software scales or becomes more complex.

There are 4 distinct pillars to learning Data Structures and Algorithms. The links to each are included below:
- [**Complexity** (in progress)]()
  
        Theory/techniques necessary to determine/compare the performance of data structures and algorithms. Before learning the following pillars, you should have a fundamental understanding of time and space complexity. You should be able to use Big O notation to represent these complexities.

- [**Data Structures** (coming soon)]()

        Methods of organizing data in software. Each data structure has pros and cons that make them suitable for specific applications. To write optimal algorithms, you must know the corresponding optimal data structures. 

- [**Sorting Algorithms** (coming soon)]()

        Algorithms used to sort data structures efficiently. There are only so many ways to sort an array. No point in reinventing the wheel when the most popular/effective methods of sorting data have already been solved. Sorting is an incredibly common step when developing algorithms. Therefore, knowing about popular sorting algorithms and their relative performances is good to know before diving into creating your own algorithms. 

- [**Algorithms** (coming soon)]()

        Sequences of well-defined instructions to perform a desired function. Writing efficient algorithms means being aware of the above topics when designing.
