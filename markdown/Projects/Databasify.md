# Databasify
Databasify is a web application written with Flask and Bootstrap that can query song information using the Spotify API. 
The information is populated into a database where users can generate custom playlists based on a number of song metrics beyond those shown in the Spotify app.
Such metrics include properties such as tempo, popularity, and even danceability. 
The project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rlisowski10/Databasify/).
