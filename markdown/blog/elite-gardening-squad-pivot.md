# Elite Gardening Squad Pivot
### Jan 4, 2021

Happy new year! I haven't posted an update in a while so I figured I should talk about some of the stuff I've been busy with.
Last year, a team of friends and I started a game development project together.
Our eager minds pitched several intriguing game concepts until we settled on a coop dungeon crawler called Elite Gardening Squad.
Expectedly, as time passed, the team's passion for game development faded as people prioritized their work or other hobbies.
Fortunately, I am still eager as ever to continue developing games in my spare time.

Given the circumstances, I have decided to pivot the scope of the game to reflect the smaller team size.
Instead scrapping everything, we're taking mechanics that have already been implemented and applying them to a new concept.
This concept is a revamp of Oregon Trail fairly similar in nature to a game called Death Road to Canada.
Here's a little demo teaser:

One last thing. I'm still working through my [data structures and algorithms tutorial series](/tutorials-cheat-sheets/data-structures-and-algorithms/).
I'm excited to release the data structures component because I think a lot of people will find it helpful (my future self included).
Now that the holidays are out of the way, it'll be done fairly soon.
