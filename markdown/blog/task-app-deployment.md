# Task App Deployment

### July 2, 2021

My last blog post was over 3 months ago. Last you heard I was studying up in order to gain the knowledge to build and deploy a containerized full stack web application. Well, I have good news! I've created a new [website](https://paulsprojects.xyz) to house all of my future web projects. I have also officially deployed my first full-stack [application](https://taskapp.paulsprojects.xyz).

In my previous post, I talked about working on a gift exchange app idea with a friend of mine. However, learning how to build/deploy even the most basic of full stack web applications is more than enough work on its own. I decided to narrow the scope to a classic TODO list style application because it covers all the fundamentals really well. Regardless, I learned a ton. I may take on the gift exchange project next but I need to become much more familiar with GraphQL and MongoDB. Although, at this point, I feel like I've learned everything I wanted to cover before I settled down into a proper job.

I've still been working on Onion Trail, although Task App has taken up the majority of my time the past couple of months. Since my last post, I've created a wave survival system that spawns waves of enemies for the player to fight. One of the developers on my team extended my attack system and status effect infrastructure to implement a flamethrower:

</p>

I'm at the point where I have most of the mechanics I want programmed into the game. The challenge now is to learn how to build 3D environments/objects and design map layouts for the players. This is all new territory for me and I've been doing a decent amount of experimentation. Here's a preview I have for handling building interiors:

After creating/deploying a full stack web app. I feel like I know enough about what web development has to offer. While I had fun and learned a lot, it never really grabbed me like working on my game development projects have. After trying both, I've decided to look further into finding work in game development and working on Onion Trail on the side.
