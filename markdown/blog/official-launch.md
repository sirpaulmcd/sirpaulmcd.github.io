# Official Launch
### Nov 2, 2020

I've officially launched a personal website with my own custom domain `sirpaulmcd.com`.
Owning a website is something that I've always wanted to do so it's nice that I've finally found a use for one as a Software Engineering portfolio. 
Now that I have the foundation set up, it's time to expand my portfolio.
I'll be picking up another personal project soon.
I have some friends that may want to revamp the Databasify project that we worked on during our masters together.
