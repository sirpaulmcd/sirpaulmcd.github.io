# Initial ~~commit~~ Post
### Oct 26, 2020

As a Mechanical Engineer that is switching into Software Engineering, it's hard not to be intimidated by everything software has to offer.
I have recently finished an accelerated Master's program in Software Engineering and am now expected to decide where I want to work.
It's a particularly hard decision after only participating in the software world for such a short amount of time.
As a new engineer, I want to find a prosperous and stable future career. 
However, as an individual, I want to avoid selling myself short by wasting my creative potential being a cog in some big tech machine. 
While I am on the hunt for the right job, it seems only right to document my progress and lessons learned as I grow as a software developer.
I'm not entirely sure what I want to share in this blog but I know that having one is the right decision.'
