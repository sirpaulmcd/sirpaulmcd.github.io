# WarAndPeace System Completion
### Nov 23, 2020

I have an announcement to make. I'm pleased to say that I have completed the foundation for my WarAndPeace System! 
"What's that?", you say? Well, I'm glad you asked.
It's a generic software architecture for implementing a variety of weapons, obstacles, and items in the Unity game engine!

What do you mean that's not exciting???
It's a comprehensive foundation for the attack system I'm developing for my proof of concept game!
It's also a milestone in my experience as a game/software developer.
I've never made such a complex system from scratch before.

For those of you that are not impressed, here's an explosion to spice things up:

Intrigued? If so, there's plenty more gifs of weapon implementations on the [system description page](https://github.com/sirpaulmcd/Onion-Trail-Open/wiki/WarAndPeace-System). 
I also go into detail about the system architecture.
