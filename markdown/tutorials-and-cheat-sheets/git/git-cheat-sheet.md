# Git Cheat Sheet

Git is one of the most valuable software tools to have under your belt. 
However, I found that learning git wasn't as straightfoward as I would have liked. 
To make learning easier for myself, I made a cheat sheet of the various console commands and recorded examples of common use cases.
I have received very positive feedback for this cheat sheet from my peers so hopefully you find it helpful as well.
